In vivo 7T MRI dataset probing the auditory cortex collected at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), University of Minnesota, USA, by Michelle Moerel and Essa Yacoub. 

All participants have three sessions. In session 1, high-res anatomical MRI (T1w, PDw, and T2starw at 0.6 mm iso) was collected. In session 2 and 3, task functional MRI data (0.8 mm iso) was collected: using gradient echo EPI in session 2 (12 runs), and 3D GRASE in session 3 (16 runs). Note that session 1 is missing for participant 1.

Participants listen to natural sounds (144 sounds) and performed a one-back detection task.
